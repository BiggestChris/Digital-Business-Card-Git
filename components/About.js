                <p>I am an aspiring tech founder who's already got one start-up under
                his belt (ok it may have failed but still...). I've been teaching
                myself to code so I can up my understanding of tech in general
                and start building the next big thing. I expect I'll still need
                a Technical Co-founder, but this should give me a much better grounding
                and should allow me to build an MVP.</p>
